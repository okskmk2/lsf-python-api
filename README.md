# platform-python-lsf-api

These python wrappers allow customers to submit and control jobs and obtain status of queues, hosts and other LSF attributes from Python directly.  They work with various versions of LSF and are maintained by LSF developement, though we take contributions from the Open Source community.

If you plan or would like to contribute to the library, you must follow the DCO process in the attached [DCO Readme file](https://github.com/IBMSpectrumComputing/platform-python-lsf-api/blob/master/IBMDCO.md) in the root of this repository.  It essentially requires you to provide a Sign Off line in the notes of your pull request stating that the work is clear of infinging work by others.  Again, for more details, please see the DCO Readme file.

## Introduction

This library allows you to call the LSF APIs directly through Python.  [You can find more information and usage notes here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/New%20IBM%20Platform%20LSF%20Wiki/page/Integrations%2C%20APIs%2C%20and%20samples). The wrapper is created using Pythons SWIG interface and links directly to LSF's shared libraries. 

You are encouraged to contribute your own Python wrappers to the Open Source LSF APIs for Python, and you may find some examples in [IBM Platform LSF Wiki](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/New%20IBM%20Platform%20LSF%20Wiki/page/Using%20the%20Python%20wrapper%20for%20LSF%20API).

IBM provides formal support for this software to entitled clients via the normal IBM support channels.

This software is Licensed under the Eclipse Public License.

Please note you must use lsf.lsb_init before any other LSBLIB library routine in your application.

## Installation

Before compiling the library, set the LSF environment variables.

To compile and install the library, go to the main source directory
and type:

`$ python setup.py build`

`$ sudo python setup.py install`

## Community Contribution Requirements

Community contributions to this repository must follow the [IBM Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://github.com/IBMSpectrumComputing/platform-python-lsf-api/blob/master/IBMDCO.md) process and only through GitHub Pull Requests:

 1. Contributor proposes new code to community.

 2. Contributor signs off on contributions 
    (i.e. attachs the DCO to ensure contributor is either the code 
    originator or has rights to publish. The template of the DCO is included in
    this package).
 
 3. IBM Spectrum LSF development reviews contribution to check for:
    i)  Applicability and relevancy of functional content 
    ii) Any obvious issues

 4. If accepted, posts contribution. If rejected, work goes back to contributor and is not merged.
